# ArcadeBootlegs-MustPlay
Must play bootleg variants (in Mame)

 The powershell script creates a separate copy of the clones from merged parent files.  How you want to incorporate these into your collection is up to you.  I created a new system in Batocera for this.

 clones-table.txt is just a text list of parent and clone variants

 **No actual rom files are available on this repository, it is merely informational only**
